## Git workflow

### Features and branches

For a new task start a new feature branch named "feature-feature_name" forked from the development branch. If finishing the feature takes multiple days I recommend merging from the main branch into your feature branch each day to make the eventual merging into main simpler. Pull request should relate to a single task in Monday. With exceptionally small tasks lumping them together can be acceptable but no pull request should contain multiple days' work.

Keep the feature branch up to date. Push changes even if they are not complete. There is no requirement that feature branches should be in a functioning state before they are completed.

Once a feature is complete move task to the Review column om Monday and submit a merge request on github.

### Paid (one would need to request a seat)

AutoHand: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/auto-hand-vr-physics-interaction-165323
//Add scripts that require manual replacement to gitignore or at least have them uploaded in the cloud and put a link here.

Hospital props: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/hospital-props-vol-1-6-mega-pack-178128

Note: unlike hospital props, which is distributed per company (with unlimited seats), AutoHand is distributed per-seat, so the company would need to either re-assign the existing seats or buy some new ones to let anyone else run/build the project.

### Free
