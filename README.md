### Paid (one would need to request a seat)

AutoHand: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/auto-hand-vr-physics-interaction-165323
//Add scripts that require manual replacement to gitignore or at least have them uploaded in the cloud and put a link here.

Hospital props: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/hospital-props-vol-1-6-mega-pack-178128

Note: unlike hospital props, which is distributed per company (with unlimited seats), AutoHand is distributed per-seat, so the company would need to either re-assign the existing seats or buy some new ones to let anyone else run/build the project.

### Free
